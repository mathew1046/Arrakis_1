# Distribution Manager Dashboard Release Data Consistency Update

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure data consistency between the Overview tab and Releases tab in the Distribution Manager Dashboard.

## Analysis and Findings

I conducted a thorough analysis comparing the data between the Overview tab (`DistributionManagerDashboard.tsx`) and Releases tab (`ReleaseManagement.tsx`) components.

### Release Date Consistency
❌ **INCONSISTENT**: Found discrepancy in release dates.

| Component | Before Correction | After Correction |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Overview tab | March 15, 2024 | November 15, 2025 |
| Releases tab | November 15, 2025 | November 15, 2025 |

The release date in the Overview tab has been updated to match the theatrical release date in the Releases tab.

### Platform Naming Consistency
❌ **INCONSISTENT**: Found discrepancies in platform names and availability.

| Platform in Overview | Status in Overview | Before: Releases Tab | After: Releases Tab |
|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Netflix | Live | Netflix | Netflix |
| HBO Max | Live | HBO | HBO Max |
| Amazon Prime | Live | Not explicitly listed | Amazon Prime |
| Disney+ | Pending | Not present | Added release window |
| Apple TV+ | In Review | Not present | Not present |
| Hulu | Live | Not present | Not present |
| Paramount+ | Negotiating | Not present | Not present |
| Peacock | Live | Not present | Not present |

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Release Date in Overview Tab**:
   - Changed `releaseDate` from '2024-03-15' to '2025-11-15' in `DistributionManagerDashboard.tsx` to match the theatrical release date

2. **Platform Naming Consistency**:
   - Changed 'HBO' to 'HBO Max' in `ReleaseManagement.tsx` for consistency with the Overview tab
   - Changed 'Various Digital (iTunes, Amazon, etc.)' to 'Amazon Prime' for the TVOD/EST release window
   
3. **Added Missing Platform**:
   - Added a new release window for Disney+ to match its presence in the Overview tab
   - Set appropriate dates and deliverables for this release window

## Considerations for Further Improvement

While the most critical inconsistencies have been addressed, several platforms mentioned in the Overview tab (Apple TV+, Hulu, Paramount+, Peacock) are not explicitly included in the Releases tab. These could be added in a future update if more comprehensive release schedules are needed.

## Verification

After these changes:
- The main theatrical release date now matches between Overview and Releases tabs
- Platform naming is consistent between tabs
- Additional release windows have been added to represent more platforms shown in the Overview tab

These changes ensure that users see consistent information across different tabs in the Distribution Manager Dashboard.
