# Updated Distribution Dashboard Release Data Consistency

This document provides additional updates to ensure complete data consistency between the Overview tab and Releases tab in the Distribution Manager Dashboard.

## Recent Changes Made

Building upon previous consistency updates, the following additional changes have been implemented:

### 1. Added All Missing Platforms from Overview Tab

Four platforms that were present in the Overview tab but missing from the Releases tab have now been added:

| Platform | Status in Overview | Added to Releases Tab | Status in Releases Tab |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Hulu | Live | ✅ Yes | active |
| Peacock | Live | ✅ Yes | active |
| Apple TV+ | In Review | ✅ Yes | scheduled* |
| Paramount+ | Negotiating | ✅ Yes | scheduled* |

*Note: The ReleaseWindow interface in ReleaseManagement.tsx only allows for specific status values: 'scheduled', 'active', 'completed', or 'cancelled'. We've used the closest matching status.

### 2. Updated Status Values for All Platforms

Ensured that the status values for each platform in the Releases tab align with their status in the Overview tab:

| Platform | Status in Overview | Updated Status in Releases |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| Netflix | Live | active |
| Amazon Prime | Live | active |
| HBO Max | Live | active |
| Hulu | Live | active |
| Peacock | Live | active |
| Disney+ | Pending | scheduled |
| Apple TV+ | In Review | scheduled |
| Paramount+ | Negotiating | scheduled |

### 3. Added Release Dates and Metadata

For all newly added platforms, appropriate release dates, marketing deadlines, and deliverables have been added to maintain consistency with the existing release windows.

## Summary of All Consistency Updates

Combined with the previous updates, the following have now been addressed:

1. ✅ Release date in Overview tab now matches the theatrical release date
2. ✅ All platforms from Overview tab are now represented in Releases tab
3. ✅ Platform status values are aligned as closely as possible between tabs
4. ✅ Release windows include appropriate dates and metadata

The Distribution Manager Dashboard now presents consistent information across both the Overview tab and Releases tab, providing users with a cohesive experience when navigating between them.
