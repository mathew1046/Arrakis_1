# Dashboard Consistency Update

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure data consistency between the Overview tab and Platforms tab in the Distribution Manager Dashboard.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Platform Status Naming Conventions

The overview dashboard used different status names compared to the platform management component:
- "Live" vs. "active"
- "In Review" vs. "pending" (for Apple TV+)
- "Pending" vs. "pending"
- "Negotiating" vs. "negotiating"

**Solution**: Added a status mapping function `getDisplayStatus` to ensure platform statuses are displayed consistently across components.

### 2. Platform Listing

Originally, not all platforms shown in the overview were included in the platform management component:
- Added all platforms to match the dashboard overview
- Ensured all platform data is consistent (revenue, views, ratings)

### 3. Platform Naming

Fixed naming inconsistencies:
- Changed "Amazon Prime Video" to "Amazon Prime" to match the dashboard overview

### 4. Status Filter Options

Updated the status filter dropdown options in the platform management component to display the same status names as the dashboard overview:
- Changed "Active" to "Live" in the filter dropdown

### 5. Data Structure Alignment

Made sure the data structure and values in the platform component aligned with what's shown in the dashboard:
- Revenue figures
- View counts
- Ratings
- Status values

## Benefits of Consistency

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users see consistent terminology and data as they navigate between dashboard views
2. **Reduced Confusion**: Eliminates discrepancies that might confuse users about platform statuses
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Code is now better structured with clear mappings between internal data and display values

## Recommendation for Future Development

To maintain consistency across the application, consider:

1. Implementing a centralized data store for platform information
2. Creating shared constants for status values
3. Adding automated tests to verify data consistency between components
