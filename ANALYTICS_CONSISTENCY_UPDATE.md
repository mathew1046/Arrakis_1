# Distribution Dashboard Analytics Consistency Update

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure data consistency between the Overview tab and Analytics tab in the Distribution Manager Dashboard.

## Analysis and Findings

I conducted a thorough analysis comparing the data between the Overview tab (`DistributionManagerDashboard.tsx`) and Analytics tab (`DistributionAnalytics.tsx`) components.

### Platform Viewership Data
✅ **CONSISTENT**: The viewership data is already consistent between both tabs.

| Platform      | Overview Tab | Analytics Tab | Status |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| Netflix       | 450,000      | 450,000      | ✓ Matched |
| Amazon Prime  | 320,000      | 320,000      | ✓ Matched |
| HBO Max       | 280,000      | 280,000      | ✓ Matched |
| Hulu          | 150,000      | 150,000      | ✓ Matched |
| Peacock       | 50,000       | 50,000       | ✓ Matched |

### Total Viewership
✅ **CONSISTENT**: The total viewership figures match.
- Overview tab total views: 1,250,000
- Analytics tab sum of platform views: 1,250,000

### Revenue Data
❌ **INCONSISTENT**: Found a discrepancy in regional revenue totals.

Before correction:
- Overview tab total revenue: $2,450,000
- Analytics tab total regional revenue: $2,480,000 ($30,000 discrepancy)

| Region               | Before Correction | After Correction |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| North America        | $1,250,000        | $1,230,000       |
| Europe               | $720,000          | $720,000         |
| Asia Pacific         | $380,000          | $370,000         |
| Latin America        | $85,000           | $85,000          |
| Middle East & Africa | $45,000           | $45,000          |
| **TOTAL**            | **$2,480,000**    | **$2,450,000**   |

## Changes Made

1. Updated the `mockRegionPerformance` array in `DistributionAnalytics.tsx`:
   - Adjusted North America revenue from $1,250,000 to $1,230,000
   - Adjusted Asia Pacific revenue from $380,000 to $370,000
   - This brings the total regional revenue to $2,450,000, matching the Overview tab

## Verification

After these changes, all key metrics are now consistent across both the Overview and Analytics tabs of the Distribution Manager Dashboard:
- Platform viewership numbers match
- Total viewership figures match
- Total revenue figures match ($2,450,000)

This consistency ensures that users see the same information regardless of which tab they're viewing, providing a more reliable and trustworthy user experience.
