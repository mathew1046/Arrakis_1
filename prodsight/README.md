- API calls are simulated with realistic delays
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Easy to replace with real backend endpoints

### AI Integration Ready
- AI features are implemented as mock services
- Easy to swap with real AI/ML endpoints
- Consistent interface for all AI operations
- Proper loading states and error handling
